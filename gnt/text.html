<h2 align=center> The Text </h2>

The text is derived from N.A.&nbsp;26, via a parsed and lemmatized edition put out by the
<a href=//ccat.sas.upenn.edu/teachtech/about-ccat.html>Center for the Computer Analysis of Texts</a>
at the <a href=//www.upenn.edu>University of Pennsylvania</a>.	This was corrected and
expanded by James Tauber.  Tauber's file, and many other editions of the Greek N.T., are
available from <a href=//www.znet.com/~broman/editions.html>Vincent Broman's web site</a>. <p>

There were some remaining errors in Tauber's file, which were corrected by me.
I also made some minor changes to facilitate processing.  These changes are all fully described
at the link below. <p>

The resulting text file was then translated by me (using a computer program, of course) into a large
random-access binary file, containing extra information to enable fast access to the text and
morphology, and an embedded polytonic Greek font.  It is this file that the web interface uses. <p>
