The following bugs have been found and fixed.

<ul>
   <li> In the mchine-readable GNT file which the web interface uses,
	the base form of E)DEI was bizarrely given as E)SQIW in several places.
	This has been corrected.  Thanks to Julian Clementson for spotting this.
	For a full list of corrections to the text, and minor changes made to facilitate
	processing, see <a href=/~fisher/gateway/gnt/texts/tauber/ajf-changes>this page</a>.
	&nbsp; <i>4 Nov 99</i> <p>

   <li> Some chapters have missing verses.  (E.g. Mt 18:11 is missing.)	 Because of a bug
	in the program, this caused verse numbers to be out by one in some cases.
	&nbsp; <i>4 Nov 99</i> <p>

   <li> Because of a programming error, searches for words containing a rho with a rough breathing
	did not work.  &nbsp; <i>22 Dec 99</i> <p>
</ul>
